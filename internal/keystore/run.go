package keystore

// The exec contract every store command runs under — the same contract the config resolver runs an
// `api_key_cmd:` under, because these commands are the same kind of thing: a credential tool, run by
// llama-launcher on the user's behalf, from a process that owns the terminal.
//
// No shell. The argv is built here, word by word, from values llama-launcher decided; there is
// nothing for a shell to add but the chance that a character in a server name means something.
//
// No terminal, and stdin is ours. The child may be running under the interactive menu holding the
// screen, so a tool that tried to prompt there would draw over the frame and read the keystrokes
// meant for llama-launcher — a store that must ask the human to unlock has to do it through its own
// GUI agent. Stdin belongs to the write: it is how the secret reaches the tool without passing
// through an argument vector.
//
// Bounded, always. A store tool can block for a very long time — a locked keychain, a bus autolaunch
// waiting on a session that will never come — and an unbounded wait on the startup path is
// indistinguishable from a hung llama-launcher.
//
// The environment is inherited whole, deliberately: `security` and `secret-tool` need HOME, DISPLAY,
// the D-Bus address and their agents' sockets, and these are llama-launcher's own fixed invocations
// rather than anything a user or a model supplied.

// fragment. Redaction cannot take that back — it replaces whole occurrences of the secret, and half a
// secret is not one — so the fragment would ride into the refusal message, which is the readable
// place (terminal, session log, pasted bug report) the migration exists to get the key out of. Half a
// key is worth having, too: it names the issuer and the shape, and shortens a guess.
//
// So when, and only when, the buffer filled to the cap — the one condition under which the text may
// have been cut mid-word — the longest tail that spells the beginning of the key is dropped. Both
// spellings are checked for the reason redactKey checks both: on macOS the key travels quoted, so
// what the cut leaves behind is the beginning of the quoted word. A tail that is the WHOLE key is
// left to redactKey, which marks its place — that reads better than a sentence ending nowhere.
