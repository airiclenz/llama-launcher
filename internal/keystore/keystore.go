// Package keystore reaches the machine's own secret store through the command-line tool the
// operating system already ships, so a plaintext `api_key:` in the config file can be moved into
// that store and the entry left pointing back at it with an ordinary `api_key_cmd:` line.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a keychain library. llama-launcher links no D-Bus client and no Keychain
// framework: the store is spoken to the way every other external program is spoken to, which is what
// keeps a container, a headless box and a Windows machine from carrying code they can never run, and
// what makes migration's product an ORDINARY key source. What it writes into the config file is a
// command line the user could have typed themselves, read by the same resolver that reads every
// other `api_key_cmd:`; nothing here is a private channel between llama-launcher and the store.
//
// A platform is covered only when llama-launcher can do BOTH halves — write the secret in AND hand
// back the exact command that reads it out again. macOS ships `security` on every install. Linux has
// `secret-tool` only when libsecret is installed, and a keyring behind it only when a secret service
// is actually answering on the bus — the two are independent, which is why the Linux probe ASKS the
// service a question instead of trusting the binary's presence: the headless machines small models
// are hosted on frequently carry the tool and nothing behind it. Every other platform reports no
// store, and the caller tells the user what they can do by hand instead of offering half a move.
//
// The secret itself only ever travels on the tool's STDIN. An argv is world-readable on both
// platforms (`ps`, /proc/<pid>/cmdline), so passing the key as an argument would publish it to every
// process on the machine for as long as the write takes — a strange price to pay for a migration
// whose entire purpose is getting that key out of a readable place.
//
// This package is vendored from apogee's `internal/keystore/` at commit 1c0037b, adapted to
// llama-launcher's service name and its underscore config keys. Go's `internal/` rule means a shared
// module is the only alternative to a copy, and neither project wants one yet: the two copies are
// expected to drift apart rather than together.
