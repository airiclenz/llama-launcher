## Feature ideas

- [ ] Shell completions (bash/zsh/fish)
  - Tab-complete profile names for `load`, `unload`, and the new `start --profile`
  - Tab-complete backend names for `stop` and `logs`
  - Tab-complete subcommand names
  - Data is already available from config; generate completion scripts via a `completions` subcommand

- [ ] Config diff on profile switch
  - When switching models in the interactive menu, show what parameters will change
  - Display differences between current and target profile (gpu_layers, context_size, backend, etc.)
  - `formatProfileParams` already exists; this is mostly UI wiring to show a side-by-side or delta view
  - Helps users confirm they're switching to the right configuration before waiting for the server restart

- [ ] Display a GPU%-bar-grapth
